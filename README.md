## Description
This program is a character game, where you can choose between four different characters.
The game begins with the player creating a character, where you can choose to be either a:
- Mage
- Ranger
- Rogue
- Warrior

Once you have chosen a character, it is time to equip weapon and armour, to defend yourself against an enemy.
Each character can equip different weapons and armour, which deals or protects damage and attacks from an opponent.
The weapons can only by equipped to weapon slot, while armour can be equipped to either head, legs or body.
There are seven types of weapons and four types of armours.

The weapon types are:
- Axe
- Bow
- Dagger
- Hammer
- Staff
- Sword
- Wand

The amour types are:
